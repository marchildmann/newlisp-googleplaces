;; Textsearch
;; The Google Places API Text Search Service is a web service that returns information about a set of Places based on a string â€” for example "pizza in New York" or ;; "shoe stores near ottawa". The service responds with a list of Places matching the text string and any location bias that has been set. The search response will ;; include a list of Places, you can send a Place Details request for more information about any of the Places in the response.

;; Place Check-Ins
;; Once you have a reference from a Place Search request, you can use it to indicate that a user has checked in to that Place.
;; Check-in activity from your application is reflected in the Place search results that are returned - popular establishments 
;; are ranked more highly, making it easy for your users to find likely matches.
;; As check-in activity changes over time, so does the ranking of each Place.

;; POST https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/check-in/json?sensor=true_or_false&key=AddYourOwnKeyHere HTTP/1.1

;; Place Details
;; Once you have a reference from a Place Search request, you can request more details about a particular establishment
